# Introduction:

     Many people are using program to play games automatically. I am also striving to develop a program that can automatically play the dancing<br>
     game I used to enjoy during my childhood. In this game, players need to press the arrow keys at specific intervals. Once all the arrows have <br>
     been pressed, players must press the space or control key to obtain a score at a specific location.<br>
